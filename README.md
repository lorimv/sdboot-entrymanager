# sdboot-entrymanager
Automating updates to 'esp'/loader/entries/\*.conf files used by systemd-boot

I'm writing this package for linux mint, but I'll clarify what systems it works on when I actually write it

Assuming I'll be using APT specific tools -- though I could make it a general command that the user adds to their package manager or whatever
